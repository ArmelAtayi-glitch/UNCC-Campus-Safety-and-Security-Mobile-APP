# UNCC Campus Safety and Security Mobile App (Project Plan)

## Project Overview
This project was completed as part of an Information Technology course and focuses on the planning, design, and management of a proposed UNCC Campus Safety and Security Mobile Application. The purpose of the project is to demonstrate the application of IT project management principles to a real-world campus safety challenge.

The proposed mobile application aims to improve communication between students, faculty, and campus security by providing real-time alerts, incident reporting capabilities, and easy access to campus safety resources.

## Project Objectives
- Improve campus safety through mobile technology
- Enable real-time incident reporting and emergency alerts
- Provide quick access to campus safety resources
- Apply IT project management methodologies in a practical scenario

## Key Features (Proposed)
- User authentication with role-based access
- Incident reporting with location and optional visual evidence
- Emergency alert notifications
- Live campus security updates
- Secure data transmission and privacy protection
- User training and documentation

## Project Structure
- Initiation Phase
- Planning Phase
- Executing Phase
- Controlling Phase
- Closing Phase

Each phase includes scope definition, assumptions, constraints, scheduling, risk management, quality planning, and change control.

## Risk Management
Risks were categorized as internal and external, evaluated by likelihood and impact, and prioritized using a risk matrix. Key risks included data collection delays, data validation issues, security protocol gaps, legal and regulatory changes, and vendor reliability.

## Scheduling and Planning
A Gantt chart was created using Microsoft Project to define task dependencies, timelines, and milestones. The project followed a sprint-based structure for effective execution.

## Technologies Referenced
- Cross-platform mobile frameworks
- Firebase and cloud-based backend services
- Secure authentication and encryption
- Real-time notifications and data synchronization

> Note: This project focuses on planning and design only. The application is not fully implemented.
